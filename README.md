# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis-Python-SQL-Power-BI-
This project examines customer purchasing behavior using transactional data from approximately 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories. The analysis aims to identify spending patterns, customer segmentation, product preferences, and subscription trends to inform data-driven strategic business decisions.


Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
1. Project Overview 
This project examines customer purchasing behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories. The analysis aims to identify spending patterns, customer segmentation, product preferences, and subscription trends to inform data-driven strategic business decisions.
2. Business Questions/Problems
Q1. What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?
Q2. Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount?
Q3. Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
Q4. Compare the average Purchase Amounts between Standard and Express Shipping?
Q5. Do subscribed customers spend more? Compare average spend and total revenue between subscribers and non-subscribers
Q6. Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
Q7. Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their total number of previous purchases, and show the count of each segment
Q8. What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
Q9. Are customers who are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) also likely to subscribe? 
Q10. What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

3. Dataset Summary 
Rows: 3,900 
Columns: 18 
Key Features: -Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status), Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color), Shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, Review Rating, Shipping Type) 
Missing Data: 37 values in the Review Rating column 

 4. Exploratory Data Analysis using Python 
We began with data preparation and cleaning in Python: 
● Data Loading: Imported dataset using pandas. 
● Initial Exploration: Used df.info() to check structure and .describe() for summary statistics.

● Missing Data Handling: Checked for null values and imputed missing values in the Review Rating column using the median rating of each product category. 
● Column Standardization: Renamed columns for better readability and documentation. 
● Feature Engineering: Created age_group column by binning customer ages and purchase_frequency_days column from purchase data. 

● Data Consistency Check: Verified if discount_applied and promo_code_used were redundant, and dropped promo_code_used. 
● Database Integration: Connected Python script to PostgreSQL and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL analysis. 

5. Data Analysis using SQL (Business Transactions) 
We performed structured analysis in PostgreSQL to answer key business questions: 
Q1. Revenue by Gender – Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers. 
 

Q2. High-Spending Discount Users – Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount. 
 
Q3. Top 5 Products by Rating – Found products with the highest average review ratings. 
 

Q4. Shipping Type Comparison – Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping. 
 

Q5. Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers – Compared average spend and total revenue across subscription status. 
 

Q6. Discount-Dependent Products – Identified 5 products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases. 
 

Q7. Customer Segmentation – Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal segments based on purchase history. 
 

Q8. Top 3 Products per Category – Listed the most purchased products within each category. 
 

Q9. Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions – Checked whether customers with >5 purchases are more likely to subscribe. 
 



Q10. Revenue by Age Group – Calculated total revenue contribution of each age group. 
 

6. Dashboard in Power BI Finally, we built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present insights visually.  


7. Business Recommendations 
● Boost Subscriptions – Promote exclusive benefits for subscribers. 
● Customer Loyalty Programs – Reward repeat buyers to move them into the “Loyal” segment. 
● Review Discount Policy – Balance sales boosts with margin control. 
● Product Positioning – Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in campaigns. 
● Targeted Marketing – Focus efforts on high-revenue age groups and express-shipping users.
